//! Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm
// Depth First Search (DFS) is different from Breadth First Search (BFS)
// Breadth First Search (BFS) walks through the nodes level by level but Depth First Search (DFS) walks through the nodes until the end
// then it backtracks and walk through the other nodes using recursion
// in Depth First Search (DFS) we walk in track then we walk back and walk in another track
